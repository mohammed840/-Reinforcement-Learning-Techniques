## 🛠️ Getting Started

Ready to explore? Here's how:

### ✅ Prerequisites

*   Python 3.x
*   Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
*   Essential Python libraries for data science: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
*   RL-specific libraries (e.g., OpenAI Gym) - *Consider listing specific ones if consistently used.*

### 📦 Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/KishoreMuruganantham/Reinforcement-Learning-Techniques.git
    cd Reinforcement-Learning-Techniques
    ```

2.  **Set up a virtual environment (highly recommended!):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv rl_env
    source rl_env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `rl_env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    *(**Pro-Tip:** Create a `requirements.txt` file for easy setup! Run `pip freeze > requirements.txt` in your environment.)*
    If you have one:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    Otherwise, install libraries as needed:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib jupyter notebook # Add other libraries like gym
    ```

### ▶️ Running the Notebooks

1.  **Launch Jupyter:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    # or for JupyterLab fans:
    jupyter lab
    ```
2.  Navigate to the cloned directory and open any of the `.ipynb` files. Happy exploring!
